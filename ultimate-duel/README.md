## About

This project was built with React, Vanilla CSS, Express, and Socket.io. ðŸ–¥

The base opponent and player assets are drawn by pangeafilms, the rest of the models (shield, charge, etc.) were edited and composed by myself.
Music, sound effects, and background images were found online from free resources. Thank you to everyone who provided them for our use. ðŸ™Œ
